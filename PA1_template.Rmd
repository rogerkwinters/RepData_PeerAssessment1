## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_data, sum)

hist(steps_per_day$steps, breaks = 8, 
     main = paste("Histogram of Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day"), 
     xlab = "Number of Steps", 
     ylab = "Frequency")

mean(steps_per_day$steps)
median(steps_per_day$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
avg_daily_pattern <- tapply(activity_data$steps, activity_data$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

plot(row.names(avg_daily_pattern), avg_daily_pattern, type = "l", xlab = "5-min Intervals", 
        ylab = "Average Number of Steps Taken Across All Days", main = "Average Daily Activity Pattern")

largest_interval <- which.max(avg_daily_pattern)
names(largest_interval)
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
