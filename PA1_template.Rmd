hist(steps_per_day$steps, breaks = 8, 
     main = paste("Histogram of Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day"), 
     xlab = "Number of Steps", 
     ylab = "Frequency")

mean(steps_per_day$steps)
median(steps_per_day$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
